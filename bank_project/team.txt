What made this team successful or unsuccessful (tools/apps, communication, etc.)?
This group was successful in using atom with github to easily share codes. The use of comments helped during the debugging
process so the debugger can keep track of what is happening and other references that is used.
We also use other forms of communication (email and sms) if needed. This group did ran into issues when compiling, assuming
it is related to using github.
